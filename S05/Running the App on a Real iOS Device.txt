Running the App on a Real iOS Device
Of course you can also run the app on a real iOS device with ease.

Simply connect your iPhone to your Mac via USB and accept the connection on your iPhone ("Trust" the connected Mac).

Once that's done, you should be able to select your device in the devices dropdown inside of XCode.
